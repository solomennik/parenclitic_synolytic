##### Longitudinal prepÐ°ration
# I've tried different approaches, but the best was this one:
# - for each patient, for each of it's protein calculate A, B, C, D indices (please look at ptx file, slide 1 and functions/index_functions.R). 
#   Please note, we considering here all of possible lengths. If patient has a mesurment of protein p1 in time: p1_1, p1_2, p1_3, p1_4, when we will get three A (for example) indices:
#   A(p1_1,p1_2), A(p1_1,p1_2,p1_3), A(p1_1,p1_2,p1_3,p1_4)
# - In the kernel of synolitic approach instead of building svm or glm model on pair of proteins p1 and p2 we will use all 4 indices (A, B, C, D) for both proteins
#   Since the number of parameters in the kernel of the longitudinal approach is 8, and not 2 (as in the case of the usual sinolytic approach where we are using glm or svm), 
#   more complex models will be used inside this kernel, allowing automatic feature selection

# Here a dataset is created, in which indices are calculated for the original proteins.

##### LOOCV preparation
# Since the dataset is small, the loocv (namely, l2ocv) procedure on the TRIAN set was used to determine the best model.
# From the TRIAN set (with 36 patients, 18 cases and 18 controls), 18 datasets were made, in each of which a random pair of 1 case and 1 control was named as a TEST. 
# For each dataset all models were trained on 34 others patients and then the result was applied to the excluded pair. 
# At the end all these results were combined and some kind of metric was calculated (for example, AUC).
#
# For convenience of calculation by such a procedure here were created
# - a list of random pairs on the TRIAN set is created
# - for usual and for logitudinal approaches separatly: 
# --- a list of 18 datasets is created iteratively
# --- at the end (as 19 dataset) the main dataset is added (where labels are the main labels of the TRAIN and TEST)
#
# Later this 2 lists will be used in all procedures.
